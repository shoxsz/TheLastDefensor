This is a simple 2D game made with C++ 11 with SDL, OpenGL and Box2D.

## Notes
The game is an amateur game, it was build while i was learning opengl, but i could not use the newer version because i had some troubles with windows 10 and my graphic card driver, because of it the game was developed using opengl 1.1, i particularly think this can be a really good game, because of it i pretend to remake it and add more features, including: ui elements, sounds and definitely better sprites, and of course i pretend to use a newer version of opengl, and i pretend to do it as soon as i got some free time.
